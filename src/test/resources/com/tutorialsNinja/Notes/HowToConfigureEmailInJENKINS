CONFIGURE Email Notification in JENKINS [Very Important]

For practice purpose, create an email. I have created an email known as whateveremailid@gmail.com
Then there are 2 steps which needs to be done which are important in case you want to make sure your jenkins jobs are sending the emails.
Step 1- open myaccount.google.com in another tab and click on Security. 
        make sure the 2-step verification is On. 
Step 2- click on 2-step verification after it is On and give the password and then scroll down to the bottom of the page. There you will see App passwords.
        Create any app. I created something like Gmail and then the system auto generated a password for me which is 'jqqr ebeb uuyo eolf' 
Note - You have to use this password 'jqqr ebeb uuyo eolf'

        
Manage Jenkins > System Configuration > System 
There are two areas which are important in this configuration

1. Extended E-mail Notification
2. E-mail Notification

Let's first do point no 2. E-mail Notification
Since I am using a gmail therefore the SMTP Server will be stmp.gmail.com
if you want you can give @gmail.com in Default user e-mail suffix	
Click on Advanced
Click on checkbox SMTP Authentication and give User Name - whateveremailid@gmail.com and give Password - jqqr ebeb uuyo eolf
Click on Checkbox Use SSL
And give the SMTP Port to be 465 for gmail.

Click on the checkbox 'Test configuration by sending test e-mail'
Enter any email or sarthakjenkins1984@gmail.com in the Test e-mail recipient and click on the button 'Test Configuration'
It should show 'Email was successfully sent' and then go and check your inbox. If it gives any error, then please do all configurations carefully again and try.


Now we have to take care of point no 1. Extended E-mail Notification
Give SMTP server as smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port as 465
Click on Advanced > Add(Jenkins)
Give the username as whateveremailid@gmail.com
Give the password as jqqr ebeb uuyo eolf
Give any Description in case you want to and then click on Add. Giving Description is a good practice.

Now click on the Credentials drop down and select the right option.
Click on SSL Checkbox
Give Default Content Type to be HTML(text/html)

Default Recipients - give email id as you want
Default Subject
Default Content
Maximum Attachment Size

All the above 3 keep it as mentioned. Else if you want to edit something hopefully you know what to edit.

Scroll to the bottom and see in Attachments in you want to attach anything in Attach Build Log
